# Unitary and Non-Unitary Isometric Time Evolution. With the QuTiP examples.

## The Page Curve with QuTip.

**Unitarity** is a fundamental principle that ensures the conservation of probability and the reversibility of quantum states. However, conventional notions of time and causality are challenged when considering cosmological contexts like the Big Bang or the expansion of the Universe.

Considering that the quantum mechanical time evolution is **isometric** implies that the time evolution of a quantum state is not necessarily **unitary**. Still, the **inner products** between states are preserved, consistent with the idea of a deterministic wave function’s evolution. This hypothesis could potentially reconcile quantum mechanics with cosmological observations by avoiding the issues associated with **non-unitary time evolution**, such as the apparent loss of information in **black hole evaporation**.

The **Page curve**, which describes the entropy dynamics of a **black hole**, provides a framework for understanding how information is preserved during **black hole evaporation**. According to the Page curve, the entropy of a black hole initially increases as it emits Hawking radiation, reaching a maximum value at the Page time. After the Page time, the entropy starts to decrease as the emitted radiation carries away the information. This decrease in entropy suggests that the evaporation process is unitary and that information is not lost but rather encoded in the entanglement between the black hole and the radiation.

The fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, including **unitarity**, hold even in the presence of strong gravitational fields. This realization has led to the development of various theories of **quantum gravity**, such as string theory and loop quantum gravity, which aim to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity. Moreover, the universe's expansion presents another challenge to our understanding of time and causality. As the universe expands, the notion of a global time coordinate becomes ambiguous, and the concept of unitarity needs to be carefully examined. The study of quantum fields in curved spacetime has revealed that the universe's expansion can lead to the creation of particles and the generation of entanglement entropy.

By understanding how information is preserved and how entanglement entropy evolves in cosmological scenarios, we can gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing the Universe.

The time-dependent **Schrödinger equation** describes the evolution of a pure quantum state over time of a **closed quantum system**. Time evolution in quantum mechanics is described by a unitary operator, ensuring that the system's evolution is reversible and preserves the total probability. This operator is reversible and preserves the total probability (i.e., the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes remains 1. It describes the information-preserving time evolution of an isolated quantum system. It is a way to describe how a **closed quantum system** changes over time without losing information. When studying the dynamics of quantum systems using the **density operator** representation, **Schrödinger’s equation** becomes known as the **von Neumann equation**. The **density matrix** ρ is a Hermitian operator that fully describes the quantum state. If we were to solve the **Schrödinger equation** for the **coherent dynamics** of the **state vector** |ψ⟩, we would find that the solutions are oscillatory (Rabi oscillations). In real atomic systems with **incoherent processes**, such as decay between the levels, it is not possible to consider the state vector alone. To include these incoherent processes, we need the **density operator** ρ, and we then study its evolution instead of the state vector’s evolution. 

**Non-unitary isometric** time evolution, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. It's used when dealing with **open quantum systems**, which can interact with their environment. In this case, the evolution of the system is described by an **isometric** but non-unitary operator. The dynamics of an open quantum system arise from an interaction between the system of interest (the “main” system) and its environment, which together form an isolated quantum system. In **isometry**, the **inner products** between states are preserved. In the case of an atomic two-state system, the ground and excited states are **orthogonal** and this orthogonality is preserved during the evolution, which already suggests that we have the **isometric** evolution, and for the **open systems** interacting with the environment the evolution is typically **non-unitary** because the system can exchange information and energy with its environment. The **Page curve** is a **global property** of the system, while **isometry** and **orthogonality** are more specific conditions related to the inner product between states.

In the context of an **expanding universe** or a system interacting with an environment, **isometries** can describe the embedding of a smaller **Hilbert space** into a larger one, adding new degrees of freedom without affecting the **inner products**. **Black holes** emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon, leading to their eventual evaporation. This process raises questions about the fate of information that falls into the black hole. In quantum mechanics, **unitarity** ensures that the total quantum state of an isolated system is preserved over time. However, black hole evaporation seems to challenge this principle, leading to the **black hole information paradox**.

The **Page curve** illustrates the entropy of a black hole over time as it evaporates. Initially, entropy increases as the black hole emits radiation and interacts with its environment. After the Page time, entropy decreases, suggesting that information is being recovered. Isometries are maps between Hilbert spaces that preserve the inner product, ensuring that quantum states evolve without losing their essential properties. In the context of black hole evaporation, **isometries** describe how the black hole and its environment interact while preserving information.

Modeling black hole radiation with a **two-level system** (representing the black hole) and a **Drude-Lorentz bath** (representing the environment) creates an **open quantum system**. The ground and excited states of the two-level system are **orthogonal**, meaning their inner product is zero. As the system evolves, the **isometry** maps the states of the two-level system into the larger Hilbert space that includes the bath. This evolution appears non-unitary from the perspective of the two-level system alone, leading to the perception of information loss. However, the isometry ensures that the total evolution in the larger Hilbert space is unitary, preserving information through entanglement between the system and the bath.

The decrease in entropy after the **Page time** suggests that information, once scrambled and entangled with the environment, becomes unscrambled and encoded in the correlations between the black hole and the radiation. This aligns with the idea that information is not lost but preserved in the **entanglement**. **Isometries **play a crucial role in transferring information from the black hole to the radiation. By preserving the inner product and ensuring unitary evolution in the larger Hilbert space, isometries facilitate the encoding of information in the entanglement between the black hole and the environment. From the perspective of the two-level system alone, the evolution appears **non-unitary** because information is leaking into the bath. However, the overall evolution in the larger Hilbert space remains **unitary**.

There are different methods to describe **open quantum systems**. The quantum mathematical formalism provides the general framework for describing the dynamics of open quantum systems using completely positive maps and quantum operations. It establishes the basic rules and principles for how quantum systems evolve in the presence of environmental interactions.

The **Lindblad equation** (master equation in Lindblad form, quantum Liouvillian, or Lindbladian) is a **Markovian** quantum master equation that is widely used in quantum optics, quantum information, and open quantum systems. It ensures the positivity of the density matrix, providing more physically meaningful results. It is typically used for systems with weak system-bath coupling and short-time dynamics. Nevertheless, it is still an approximation to the full quantum dynamics and may not capture all the relevant physics. Markovian dynamics assumes that the system’s evolution depends only on its current state and not on its past history. However, it is essential to note that the Lindblad Master equation, which uses the Lindblad operators to describe the system’s dynamics, is based on the assumption of Markovian dynamics and weak system-environment coupling. In the case of **black hole evaporation**, these assumptions may not hold, as the system is “strongly” coupled to its environment, and the dynamics are expected to be non-Markovian.

The **Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) method**, on the other hand, could be a more suitable approach for describing the evolution of Planck-scale entanglement in black hole evaporation compared to the Lindblad Master Equation. This is because the HEOM method can handle both **non-Markovian dynamics** and strong system-environment coupling, which are expected to be relevant in the context of black hole evaporation. However, even the HEOM method may not be sufficient to fully capture the complexities of Planck-scale entanglement in black hole evaporation. At the Planck scale, the quantum nature of spacetime itself becomes important too, and the usual assumptions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime may no longer be valid. This is the regime where a full theory of quantum gravity is needed to properly describe the system’s dynamics.

However, we attempt a simple toy-model simulation for exercising a **black hole evaporation** by a **two-level system** with the help of **QuTip** (Quantum Toolbox in Python). Our goal is to obtain a Page curve.

1. One Notebook is to simulate the Page Curve entanglement dynamics in open two-level quantum systems using the Lindblad Master Equation: https://github.com/AnaKhromova/Page-Curve-QuTip/blob/main/Page_Curve_open_QS_Lindbland.ipynb
2. Another is to do the same with the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) method:

Both methods work, and with both methods we obtained the Page Curve.
